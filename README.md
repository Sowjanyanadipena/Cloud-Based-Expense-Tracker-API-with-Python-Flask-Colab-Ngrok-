# Flask + ngrok Deployment in Google Colab 🚀
This project demonstrates how to deploy a Flask web application using `ngrok` from Google Colab. It's perfect for showcasing real-time Python backends or APIs for internship demos and cloud-based use cases.
## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- Flask 3.1.1
- pyngrok 7.2.12
- Google Colab (Runtime Environment)
## 🌐 Live Demo
Public ngrok URL will be printed in the Colab output (e.g., `https://xyz123.ngrok-free.app`).
## 🧠 Project Highlights
- Runs a Flask server on Colab
- Creates a secure public tunnel using ngrok
- No need for local hosting or paid cloud platforms
- Can be extended for backend APIs or ML deployments
## 📦 How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Wait for ngrok URL to appear
4. Open the link and test the app
## 🤝 Internship-Ready Use Cases
✅ Cloud API simulation  
✅ Web server deployment  
✅ Backend service for apps  
✅ Entry-level DevOps practice
